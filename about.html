      <h2>Welcome to my personal portfolio website.</h2>
      <p>My name is Anh Pham and I am currently pursuing an Associate degree in Information Systems Technology at Northern Virginia Community College. This website serves as a professional portfolio that showcases my academic progress, career goals, and technical skills. It is designed not only to highlight my growth as a student in the IT field but also to help future employers understand who I am and what I aim to achieve.
One of the key motivations behind this project is to build a space that reflects my journey in technology from learning basic web development skills to more advanced concepts such as cloud computing and software design. Each page in this site has a purpose. The About page introduces who I am and my background. The Resume page includes my current education, completed courses, and technical skills. Although I do not have any official projects to present yet, I have included a Projects page to prepare for future additions. The Video page will contain a presentation of this site. The Contact page is where visitors can reach out to me professionally.
The site uses HTML5 and CSS3 following proper coding practices and accessibility guidelines. I have also made sure that the layout is responsive and visually organized. I chose a vibrant green theme to represent growth, energy, and a fresh mindset toward learning. Thank you for visiting and I hope this website gives you a clear picture of who I am and what I aim to become.</p>
